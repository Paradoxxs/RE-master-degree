## Cell tower

Are the antenna mounted on high places such as building at broadcast signals and receives them from user devices  

## Base station

Takes the cell towers and connect them to the GSM network.


## GSM generation

| Generation | Frequency Range | Bandwidth | Approximate Data Transfer Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1G (analog) | 800 MHz to 900 MHz | 100 MHz | Up to 2.4 Kbps |
| 2G (GSM) | 900 MHz to 1900 MHz | 900 MHz to 1900 MHz | Up to 384 Kbps |
| 3G (UMTS) | 2100 MHz | 60 MHz | Up to 42 Mbps |
| 4G (LTE) | 700 MHz to 2600 MHz | 1.9 GHz | Up to 1 Gbps |
| 5G (NR) | 600 MHz to 52.6 GHz | Up to 52 GHz | Up to 20 Gbps |

these are only approximate data transfer rates and the actual transfer rate may be lower due to other factors affecting the network performance.
